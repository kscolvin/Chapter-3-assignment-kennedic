1. Most Challenging Calculation: Which calculation was hardest and why?
- The study cost per study hour was the hardest calculation for me to understand. At first I did not do the calculation as intended. It was confusing to think of studying in terms of how much it would cost for a certain amount of hours. When studying only cost time. But the books makes sense.

2. Most Useful Data Structure: Which data type (string, list, tuple, set, dictionary) do you think is most useful for organizing real-world data? Explain.
- I really like tuples, I think it's an extremely useful way to sotre data. I think this is the most useful way to store long term data that doesn't need many edits and is moreso for documentation. 

3. Real-World Applications: Describe one way you could use these data structures in a future project or job.
- I think the use of these data structures could be used for an artistic database. I think if a store wanted an onine archive of stock sold or most popular items it would be useful to store it this way.

4. Git Experience: What was your biggest challenge learning Git? What did you find easier than expected?
- I had a very time using git. Even now I still think im using it wrong and would really enjoy more instruction. Copying the repository was very confusing and I personally, just had a very frustrating time without guidance. The videos were vague. 

5. Code Improvements: If you could add one feature to your portfolio program, what would it be?
- I would like to add the ability to search for information and organize it even more specifically. I think being able to add wider main folders, that then become more and more specific would be nice.
